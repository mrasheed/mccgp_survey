Surveys and Opinion Polls

This repo contains the html, javascript and other files necessary to setup a survey form. The form 
is connected to a publicized, pre-initialized google API through which the information is recorded
in the google sheets. Client-side error checking is performed for data validity and the server
ensures that only one response per IP address is accepted.
